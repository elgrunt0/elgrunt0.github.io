      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll start off by saying I don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand what I&amp;rsquo;ve done here. This whole process stemmed from having to do some icky dev stuff in order to keep my Intune Dev tenant active.
I still find it unbelievably moronic that MS don&amp;rsquo;t provide a tenant for testing Intune without forcing us to do dev stuff to keep it active - I&amp;rsquo;m on my 4th tenant now and it&amp;rsquo;s a PITA setting everything up again.</description>

      <description>Businesses pay tens of thousands of $currency for Microsoft Partner consultants to come in, &amp;ldquo;modernise&amp;rdquo; their EUC estate, and leave behind a plethora of bugs and issues that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t exist because said partners are supposed to be &amp;ldquo;industry experts&amp;rdquo;.
Completely unrelated, an issue I was working on at a client was with their Autopilot setup left behind from an MS partner that was causing a forced reboot mid-ESP. Shortly after entering company credentials, there would be a 10 minute reboot warning and no way to cancel - other than Shift+F10 and running shutdown -a which a normal end user wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to know.</description>

      <description>Find who created/deleted/modified a configuration profile
Not that we operate in a blame culture and I&amp;rsquo;m sure you don&amp;rsquo;t either, but sometimes you need to know who created, deleted, or modified a configuration profile because sometimes people need hit with a jabby stick!
