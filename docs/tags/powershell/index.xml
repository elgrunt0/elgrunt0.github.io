      <description>Quick one.
We have some remote DPs that are rate limited during business hours, but if an App or Package is set to High, then it&amp;rsquo;ll distribute regardless.
I wanted to see which apps and driver packages I had previously set to High priority for distribution and no longer need to be.
However, MECM doesn&amp;rsquo;t show this in any columns I could find. So I went to PowerShell.
Unfortuntely, the Get-CMApplications cmdlet doesn&amp;rsquo;t include any properties for &amp;lsquo;Priority&amp;rsquo; so, that was a bust.</description>
