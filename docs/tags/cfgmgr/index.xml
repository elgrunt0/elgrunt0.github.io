      <description>Recently when deploying 3rd Party Updates for Adobe Reader with Config Manager, I came across a bizarre error. After a quick search online, one post suggested deleting the \\machine\admin$\System32\GroupPolicy\Machine\Registry.pol
I don&amp;rsquo;t like deleting registry things, so it&amp;rsquo;s better to rename it.
But why? What has group policy got to do with Updates Deployments since Config Manager Client sets the Windows Update settings in Registry.
Lets look at the facts
The POL file date is 2 months old.</description>

      <description>Quick one.
We have some remote DPs that are rate limited during business hours, but if an App or Package is set to High, then it&amp;rsquo;ll distribute regardless.
I wanted to see which apps and driver packages I had previously set to High priority for distribution and no longer need to be.
However, MECM doesn&amp;rsquo;t show this in any columns I could find. So I went to PowerShell.
Unfortuntely, the Get-CMApplications cmdlet doesn&amp;rsquo;t include any properties for &amp;lsquo;Priority&amp;rsquo; so, that was a bust.</description>
